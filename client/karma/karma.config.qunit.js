/**
 * Qunit Tests
 * 
 * These legacy QUnit tests are interdependent and only execute as a single
 * package. A flaw in the previous node environment parameter-checking in the
 * old karma configs gave the illusion that they ran individually, but they do
 * not and probably never have. Keeping them around for now, but we should get
 * rid of them by rewriting the tests or preferrably by removing the code to
 * which they apply.
